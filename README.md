# Terminal_Ghost_Program
Just a cool looking terminal ASCII art ghost program to stare at when you are bored.

The most important modules that i have imported in the program are "time", "colorama.fore", "os".

*************************************************************************
*************************************************************************

#**PURPOSE OF THE IMPORTED MODULES**

Purpose of "time" module is to make the program change colors every 4 seconds.

Purpose of "colorama" module is to change the specific area of the ascii text so that it gives a specific color change effect when the program is in execution state.

Purpose of "os" module is to support the "clearning" of the screen after each iteration of the color changing function.

*************************************************************************
*************************************************************************

#**REQUIREMENTS**

Python already has the "time" module and "os" module pre-installed.

however you may need to install the colorama module so that the color changing function could work properly.
run the below command to install the "colorama" module.

_pip install colorama_
